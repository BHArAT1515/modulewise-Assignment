“Yes, boys are a little like shoes. 
Why? Well...They can be useful. But mainly...They are nice to look at. 
Getting the right one can be a lovely accessory to an outfit. There are times when you couldn't do without them. 
And there are times when you'd rather do without them. Get the wrong ones and they can hurt. 
There are many types and often the ones that look the nicest are completely unpractical.”
